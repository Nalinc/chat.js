#Things to remember

- Run the ```grunt build``` task before commiting changes in ```src/chat.js```.
- Use tabs. No spaces.
- Do not fix multiple issues in a single commit. Keep them one thing per commit so that they can be picked easily incase only few commits require to be merged.
- Before submitting a patch, rebase your branch on upstream `master` to make life easier for the merger.
